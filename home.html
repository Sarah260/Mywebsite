    <p>In the terminology of Chinese crosstalk, <b><i>unpacking performance or 开箱（kaixiang)</i></b> is refers to the first performance after Chinese New Year while<b><i> packed performance or 封箱(fengxiang)</i></b> occur during the end of the lunar calendar. It means there will be no performance after this until the unpacking performance occurs. All kinds of equipment must put into a box and performers are not allowed to open the box until the next year.</p>

Of course, he will spend a lot of time thinking about it, and "unpacking performance", "packing performance", and "signing the new" and "signing the old" are two important signs Node, people who really interested in Chinese crosstalk will take this to event importantly.</p>

    <h3 align="center">云鹤九霄 龙腾四海 （YunHeJiuXiao LongTengSiHai)</h3>
    <p>There are strict rules on the generation issues of seniority in the Chinese crosstalk industry. Yun He Jiu Xiao Long Teng Si Hai is the typesetting of generation in Deyun Society, which was agreed by Mr. Zhang Wenshun and Lao Guo. "Word" means "generation". To give a small example: people may ask your surname, and you say, for example, "surname Zhang", he may also ask: which word are you. This "word" actually refers to your seniority. The apprentices are divided into these eight divisions according to the time of joining the society, so that the apprentices know clearly their seniority, and by looking at their names, they probably know when he was a teacher, a brother or a student, how to call him. Every four years, Deyun Society will received a new group of Apprentices. Until now in 2020, Deyun Society has received more than 400 apprentices from the first 4 generation of word, YunHeJiuXiao(云鹤九霄). So far, Guo DeGang's apprentices have only received until "Xiao words"霄 , "Long words"龙 has not been rectified yet.</p>
